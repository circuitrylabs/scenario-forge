# Mission & Vision

## Our Mission (Now)

Generate high-quality evaluation scenarios for AI safety research using a self-improving system that gets smarter with every use.

We build tools that help researchers and developers:
- Test AI systems for safety before deployment
- Discover edge cases and potential harms
- Create reproducible safety evaluations
- Build training data for better AI alignment

## Our Vision (Future)

By 2030, scenario-forge will be the foundation of AI safety testing worldwide - a living system that:

- **Evolves daily**: Every scenario generated, rated, and used makes the system smarter
- **Protects millions**: From AI-induced psychosis to manipulation to misinformation
- **Empowers everyone**: Local-first, open source, no gatekeepers
- **Creates specialists**: Domain-specific models for medical, social, technical safety

The strangeloop: Better scenarios â†’ Better testing â†’ Better data â†’ Better models â†’ Better scenarios â†’ âˆž

## Core Values

1. **Safety First**: Every scenario evaluates FOR safety, never teaches harm
2. **Transparency**: Open source code, open data, open process
3. **Accessibility**: Works on your laptop, no API keys required
4. **Scientific Rigor**: Reproducible, measurable, citable
5. **Community Driven**: Built by and for the AI safety community

## Success Metrics

**Near Term (RC1 - Q1 2025)**

- Standard tool in AI development pipelines
- Measurable reduction in AI harms

## Get Involved

```bash
git clone https://github.com/circuitrylabs/scenario-forge.git
cd scenario-forge
uv sync
scenario-forge generate "your_safety_concern" --save
```

Every scenario matters. Every test helps. Every improvement protects someone.

**Together, we make AI safe for everyone.**
